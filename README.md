Not even close to development complete.

Basic JSON-BSON tools in C.

Features implemented:
	1.  JSON Validation -- ASCII only, untested.

Features intended:
	1.  JSON->BSON conversion
	2.  BSON->JSON conversion
	3.  UTF-8 Support (probably next up, these tools are useless without this)
	4.  BSON/JSON Searching
	5.  Visual output of a BSON/JSON structure.
